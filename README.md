# Requirement 1
I went with option 1 and am using MongoDB Atlas for backend and React as my frontend.

# Requirement 2
I made a small ecommerce site for buying coffee. I focused more making sure that backend works correct with the idea that later I can make the frontend look better.

The site allows a customer to login in and make a purchase. <br>
The site will not allow someone who does not have an account to order. <br>
The site allows for people to create an account. <br>
Once logged in a customer can view all past orders. <br>
Customers can only view their past orders and anyone elses. <br>
The cart is updated when a new item is added.  <br>
<br>
